Ethics & Privacy Statement
Purpose
This project is for research and demonstration only, using synthetic data that does not represent any real person.

Why privacy matters
In real government data, records may contain names, IDs, bank details, health, and other sensitive fields. Sharing them directly between departments can violate privacy laws and put citizens at risk.

How privacy is protected here

Synthetic data → All datasets are randomly generated with fake values.

No raw data sharing → Each department processes and trains models locally.

Privacy-preserving potential → The design supports adding federated learning and differential privacy so no personal details leave the department.

Ethical use
This system is intended to help detect fraud, prevent misuse, and improve public service delivery — never for profiling or discrimination.

Risks & mitigations

Risk: False positives could wrongly flag citizens.
Mitigation: Use anomaly scores as a signal, not a final decision — require human review.

Risk: If used with real data, privacy leaks could occur.
Mitigation: Apply encryption, privacy budgets, and access controls.

Transparency
Any real deployment should be open about how anomalies are detected, how data is protected, and how citizens can challenge mistakes.
