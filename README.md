Project name:
Federated Identity Misuse Detection

What it does:
Detects suspicious or fake records across multiple government departments without sharing raw data.
Uses synthetic datasets for Aadhaar, bank, tax, insurance, pension, telecom, and death registry.
Each department trains its own autoencoder to spot anomalies from reconstruction error.
Models can plug into a federated learning or privacy-preserving setup.

How it works (3 steps):

Generate data → Synthetic records for each department (sample_data/).

Create features → Convert records to numeric form (features/*.npy).

Train & evaluate → One autoencoder per department, save model + threshold, run evaluation.

Demo in 3 commands (after cloning repo):

bash
Copy
Edit
cd fed-id-misuse
pip install -r requirements.txt
python evaluate_local.py bank
(Replace bank with aadhaar_office, tax, insurance, etc.)

Folders & files you care about:

sample_data/ → CSV files for each department

features/ → Saved numeric features and scalers

models/ → Trained autoencoders (*_ae.pt) and thresholds (*_thresh.npy)

data_generator.py → Makes fake department data

preprocess_and_save_features.py → Turns CSV into numeric arrays

train_local_ae.py → Trains one department’s autoencoder

evaluate_local.py → Tests model, shows anomalies found

What’s ready today:

✅ Sample data for all 7 departments
✅ Features generated and saved
✅ Models trained for all 7 departments
✅ Evaluation script working

Next steps:
Make federated training fully runnable (Flower + Opacus integration).

Speaker Script (Bullet Points + 1-Minute Pitch + Demo Commands)
Bullet points to remember
Goal: detect ID misuse across departments without moving raw data

Data: synthetic for Aadhaar, bank, tax, insurance, pension, telecom, death registry

Method: 1 autoencoder per department → learns normal patterns → flags anomalies

Status: all data generated, features created, models trained, thresholds saved

Demo: run evaluation to see flagged records

Future: hook into real federated + differential privacy pipeline

1-Minute Pitch
I built a prototype to detect identity misuse across different government departments without sharing any raw data.
First, I generated synthetic datasets for seven departments — Aadhaar, bank, tax, insurance, pension, telecom, and death registry.
Then, I converted these into numeric features and trained one autoencoder per department to learn normal patterns.
The model flags any record whose reconstruction error exceeds a learned threshold.
I’ve already generated the data, created the features, and trained models for all departments.
The system can run standalone or be integrated into a federated setup with differential privacy.
Let me quickly show how it flags anomalies for a department.

Demo Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
cd fed-id-misuse
pip install -r requirements.txt
python evaluate_local.py bank
Replace bank with another department name to test others

Show sample_data/bank.csv (first 5 lines)

Show models/bank_ae.pt + models/bank_thresh.npy

Show evaluation output: “flagged X rows out of Y”
