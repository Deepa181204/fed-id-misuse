Perfect ‚ú® I‚Äôll give you a **from A ‚Üí Z summary** in **very simple words**, so you can explain clearly to your guide what you‚Äôve done so far.

## üîé Step-by-step summary of the project so far

1. **Dataset preparation**

   * You started with raw sample data (CSV-like).
   * Converted it into **features** (train/test splits saved as `.npy` files).
   * Each client (like `insurance`, `bank`, etc.) has its own local dataset in the `features/` folder.

---

2. **Local model training**

   * Each client trains a **small Autoencoder (AE)** on its own training data.
   * The AE learns a **reconstruction threshold** that decides whether input is normal or anomalous.
   * These are saved into `models/` folder as:

     * `client_ae.pt` ‚Üí the trained model
     * `client_thresh.npy` ‚Üí threshold

---

3. **Local evaluation**

   * Each client tests its model on local test data.
   * Accuracy is calculated and prepared to be sent to the server.

---

4. **Client ‚Üí Server communication**

   * A socket connection is set up (`client.py` ‚Üî `server.py`).
   * Two modes of sending updates:

     * **Mode A (accuracy-only):** client just sends `client_id,accuracy` as text.
     * **Mode B (with weights):** client sends its **model weights + accuracy + threshold**.

---

5. **Server-side logging**

   * Server receives updates from clients.
   * Updates are logged into:

     * **SQLite database (`server_updates.db`)**
     * **CSV file (`server_updates.csv`)**
   * Each entry stores client ID, accuracy, timestamp, and optionally the weights.

---

6. **Model registry at server**

   * Server keeps a copy of each client‚Äôs last uploaded model (`models/client_ae.pt`) and threshold.
   * This ensures persistence across runs.

---

7. **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)**

   * When a client sends weights, server aggregates them with the current global model.
   * If no global model exists yet, client‚Äôs model becomes the first global model.
   * Otherwise ‚Üí server averages weights (FedAvg) = combining models.
   * The result is saved as `models/global_ae.pt`.

---

8. **Server ‚Üí Client feedback**

   * After FedAvg, server immediately sends back the **updated global model** to the client.
   * Client replaces its local AE with the new global one.
   * This ensures all clients gradually converge to a stronger shared model.

---

9. **Encryption (security layer)**

   * We introduced **optional Fernet encryption** for all communication.
   * If `secret.key` is present on both client & server ‚Üí messages (accuracy or weights) are **encrypted** before sending.
   * If no key ‚Üí system still works in plaintext mode.
   * This ensures **confidentiality & integrity** of data exchange.

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status

* You have a working **end-to-end federated learning system**:

  * Local training ‚Üí client sends update ‚Üí server logs ‚Üí server aggregates ‚Üí server returns global model ‚Üí client updates itself.
* Everything is logged in **both CSV and database**.
* Encryption is already built-in (just needs `secret.key` file).
* Tested successfully with one client (`insurance`) ‚Äî updates go roundtrip correctly.

---

## üìù How you can tell your guide

> ‚ÄúWe built a federated learning pipeline from scratch. Each client trains a local anomaly detection autoencoder, sends either accuracy or full model weights to the server. The server logs updates in both SQLite and CSV, aggregates models using FedAvg, and sends back the global model to the client. Clients update themselves with the improved global model. We also added end-to-end encryption so that all updates are secure. The full system has been tested successfully with real client updates.‚Äù

Would you like me to now write this as a **1-page crisp project progress report** (with headings: dataset prep, local training, server logging, federated loop, encryption), so you can hand it to your guide?
